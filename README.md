Global Game Jam 2022 project: Hazzah The Helpful Hydra
Theme: Duality
Unity Project, should be runnable and compilable using the Unity editor.

Description:
Codename: Hazzah the Helpful Hydra
Genre: Adventure RPG
Aim: Step into the flippers (talons? Claws? Necks?) of Hazzah, the Helpful Hydra, as he wanders the streets of Chordata City, assisting anyone he finds. The citizens have many problems, but Hazzah will help them all!
Little does Hazzah know, the issues on the streets go deeper than he ever thought. 
Goal: Explore the world, finding people with problems, listening to them and locating clues nearby to find out how best to help them.
Actions: While near an NPC, press A to tell Haz to start talking to them. Alternatively, pressing B will force Zah to converse with the random citizen. Dialogue choices Hazzahâ€™s two heads make will affect the information you can gather, and how the townsfolk will react to you.
